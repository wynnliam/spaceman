# Spaceman
A simple web-based walking simulator. My goal for this application is to better familiarize
myself with front-end web tools, but to also put all my awesome ray caster levels in a single
game. Also, my goal is to make an MVP as quickly as possilbe.

The premise of Spaceman is that you are a spaceman exploring at least one planet, but hopefully more.
You walk around a tile-based world and on some tiles you can explore Points of Interest. These Points
of Interest can be further explored in a pseudo-3D environment.

## The Minimum Viable Product
In this section, I'll detail the bare-bones application:

* The user should be able to walk around at least one tile grid
* The user should be able to explore points of interest that are rendered via ray casting

And that's about it. I could further flesh this out, but I think this is sufficient.

## Beyond the MVP
In the future, I'd like to add more features and content. Namely, more points of interest
and whatnot. As I plan more content, I'll try to post that here.
